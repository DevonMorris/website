## Work

My life mission is to create simple, generic, and highly-flexible systems to
solve the biggest problems in autonomy and robotics. I have a broad background
in mathematics, electrical engineering and computer science that has put me on
the path to achieve this mission.

## Professional Background

I worked at [Tangram Vision](https://www.tangramvision.com/) as a senior perception engineer.

I worked at [Torc Robotics](https://torc.ai/) as a software engineer, product owner, and calibration tech lead.

I worked at [Aurora Flight Sciences](https://www.aurora.aero/) as an autonomy engineer.

## Educational Background

I completed a masters degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology.

I completed a masters degree in Electrical Engineering from Brigham Young University.

I completed an undergraduate degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Brigham Young University.

## Personal

I am a husband to a wonderful wife and a father to two young boys. I love spending time with my family and seeing the world through my boysâ€™ eyes.

Digital minimalism, software customization and workflow optimization is my addiction. I love linux, neovim, and custom keyboards.

I was a **proud** user of a [Nokia 225](https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_us/nokia-225-4g?sku=16QENB11A01) since from April 2022 - October 2023.

I am **the preeminent** chicken sandwich reviewer on [github](https://github.com/chicken-sando/chicken-sando).

I obsessively [repeat music](https://github.com/DevonMorris/repeat_one) to trigger flow state.

When I'm really on my game, I repeatedly [yank a chain on the erg](https://log.concept2.com/profile/1546802)
