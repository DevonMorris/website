My previous website was based on a zettelkasten tool called
[neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron). I really did enjoy setting up that
website and enjoyed learning about the method of [zettelkasten](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes) to organize notes.

However, as time passed, I realized it wasn't for me for a few reasons
* I rarely went back to review my notes and pay the painful process of navigating links/backlinks
* Not all my notes were in a condition that I wanted to publish on the internet (some were simply notes!)
* The [integration with vim](https://github.com/oberblastmeister/neuron.nvim) didn't actually help (my brain engages differently with vim vs Notion)
* Neuron eventually was deprecated and also changed too quickly for a tool I only occasionally engaged with.

This final point, in particular, soured me. Their github page says

> neuron is a future-proof app for managing your plain-text notes in
> Zettelkasten style, as well as for publishing them on the web. Read its
> philosophy.
>
> Checkout Emanote, neuron's successor! Neuron is being superceded
> by Emanote: https://github.com/srid/emanote

I realize that this *promise* isn't wholly violated since Neuron zettels are stored
in plain text md, but it was enough to make me question whether I wanted to
rely on that project *ad infinitum*.

For these reasons, I'm migrating my website to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo
seems to have a large following, is written in [golang](https://go.dev/) and
will stick around for the foreseeable future. Even if Hugo goes the way of the
dinosaur, my posts will still be in plain text so migration should not be a
herculean task.

Leveraging Hugo and a personal second brain in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), I
hope to produce more insightful and longer blog posts here. This blog will
*hopefully* be the culmination of knowledge *a la* Tiago Forte's
[CODE](https://fortelabs.com/blog/the-4-levels-of-personal-knowledge-management/)
framework.

**P.S.** As part of this migration of content. I only plan on migrating the posts I
find particularly useful or insightful. This also may also take the form of
consolidating posts.
